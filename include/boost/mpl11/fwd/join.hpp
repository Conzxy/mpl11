     * The sequence operations supported byÂ `join` is the intersection of the
     * sequence operations supported by the joined sequences. However, in
     * order for `join` to be a `RandomAccessSequence`, all the sequences must

     *
     * @todo
     * Consider allowing 0 or 1 sequence to be joined.
     *
     * @todo
     * Consider creating a similar sequence that takes a sequence of
     * sequences.
     *
     * @todo
     * Use folds instead of hand-crafted recursion in the implementation.
