It might be proposed as a replacement\r\nfor the MPL in the future, but there is no guarantee.\r\n\r\nThe code is unstable at the moment; do not use for production.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nA conformant C++11 compiler (a conformant C++11 standard library\r\nis _not_ required).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\nThe __mpl11__ is a header only library. Just add the _include_ directory to\r\nyour compiler's search path and you are good to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nThe documentation is still incomplete, but it's available\r\n[here](http://ldionne.github.io/mpl11).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nTo compile the tests, you will also need to have CMake installed.\r\nIf this is the case, you can go to the root of the project and do:\r\n\r\n    $ mkdir build\r\n    $ cd build\r\n    $ cmake ..\r\n    $ make unit # Compiles the tests. All tests are compile-time only.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
